###### What is TypeScript ######
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning that it does everything that JavaScript does, but with some added features.

The main reason for using TypeScript is to add static typing to JavaScript. Static typing means that the type of a variable cannot be changed at any point in a program. It can prevent a LOT of bugs!

###### Example #######
// JavaScript
let foo = "hello";
foo = 55; // foo has changed type from a string to a number - no problem

// TypeScript
let foo = "hello";
foo = 55; // ERROR - foo cannot change from string to number

##### Primitive and Non-primitive #####
Mutability: Primitive data types are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once assigned. Non-primitive data types are mutable and can be modified.

##### Primitive DataTypes #####
string,number,bigint,boolean,undefined,null,symbol
